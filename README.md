# Udacity FEND Project 3, Rob Haney

## Basic Game Information 
This Object oriented javascript implementation of a modified version of the classic arcade game Frogger should be compatible and possible to play in any recent version of common web browsers. It has been tested in Firefox 43.0.4 and Chrome 47.0.2526.111. Load the game by clicking on the index.html file, or by using the browser 'File->Open File' command. 

The basic strategy is to collect points by picking up gems and reaching the water at the top of the gameboard, while avoiding the marauding army of beetles speeding across the screen. The player has three lives to accumulate as many points as possible.

## Player Movement 
Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the player up, down, right or left.

## Scoring 
Gems are worth one point, while reaching the water is worth 10 points.
